# ACLED Spatiotemporal Protest Diffusion Model

This repository contains a reproducible first-stage spatiotemporal prediction pipeline for studying protest diffusion in Africa using protest-only ACLED event data from January 2000 through December 2020.

## Research question

How do protests spread over time and space in Africa?

## Hypotheses

- **H1 Spatial diffusion:** protests in nearby grid cells raise the risk of protest in the focal cell, even after accounting for the focal cell's own 1-month, 2-month, 6-month, and 1-year protest history.
- **H2 Scale robustness:** the same broad pattern should be visible when the grid is made smaller, 50 x 50 km, or larger, 200 x 200 km.
- **H3 Fatality heterogeneity:** nonfatal protests produce stronger spillover effects than fatal protests. The event-level variable `fatal_protest` is coded as `1` when an ACLED protest event has one or more fatalities and `0` otherwise.

## Main setup

- Unit of analysis: grid-cell x month
- Main grid: independent African land grid at 100 x 100 km, built from Natural Earth country boundaries
- Optional robustness grids: 50 x 50 km and 200 x 200 km
- Training target period: 2000-2012
- Validation target period: 2013-2015, used for model and threshold choices
- Final test target period: 2016-2020
- Main target: whether a grid cell has at least one protest event next month
- Main model family: logistic regression, with random forest used as a predictive benchmark

## Quick start: local computer

1. Clone the repository.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Mat99999/acled-spatiotemporal-conflict-model.git
cd acled-spatiotemporal-conflict-model
```

2. Create and activate a Python environment.

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

On Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

3. Install dependencies.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Open and run the notebook.

```bash
jupyter notebook notebooks/acled_spatiotemporal_grid_model.ipynb
```

If you use VSCode, open the repository folder and run the notebook with the environment created above.

## Quick start: Google Colab

Open the notebook in Colab: https://colab.research.google.com/github/Mat99999/acled-spatiotemporal-conflict-model/blob/main/notebooks/acled_spatiotemporal_grid_model.ipynb

The notebook is designed to avoid hard-coded local file paths. Once this repository is on GitHub, you can open `notebooks/acled_spatiotemporal_grid_model.ipynb` in Colab. If the notebook is opened directly from GitHub and the project files are not present in the Colab runtime, the setup cell clones this repository automatically and reads `data/new data/comprehensive protest data.csv`.

## Notebook

`notebooks/acled_spatiotemporal_grid_model.ipynb` is the main research notebook. It:

1. Loads and validates the comprehensive ACLED protest CSV.
2. Builds an independent African land grid using Natural Earth boundaries.
3. Aggregates ACLED protest events into a cell-month panel.
4. Creates local lag features and neighboring-cell protest features.
5. Uses 2000-2012 for training, 2013-2015 for validation, and 2016-2020 for the final test.
6. Trains and tests logistic regression and random forest models.
7. Compares local-history models against local-plus-neighbor models.
8. Adds formal fatal versus nonfatal neighboring-protest diagnostics for H3.
9. Adds ranking, PR curve, calibration, map-like, and optional robustness diagnostics.
10. Saves outputs and displays the main charts inline.

## Notes

This is a first-stage predictive design, not a causal model. Evidence that neighboring-cell features improve prediction should be interpreted as evidence of spatiotemporal clustering or diffusion patterns in the ACLED protest data, not proof that protests in one cell cause protests in another.

The repository includes generated outputs for convenience, but they can be recreated by running the notebook from the repository root.
